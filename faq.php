                        <span><b>Q. How do I upload presentations to the site?</b><br></span>

                        <span><b> Q. Will the Internet and WiFi setup be good enough for a large crowd? Should I get a datacard?</b><br></span>
                        <span>A. We try really hard to arrange good Internet at the venue. Most of the times it is adequate. But the unpredictable amount of usage during the event sometimes causes some problems. So it is fine if you donâ€™t carry a data card, but there is no harm in being prepared for the worst.</span>
